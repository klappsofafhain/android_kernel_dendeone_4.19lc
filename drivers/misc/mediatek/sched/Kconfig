	help
	  Scheduler optimizations for heterogeneous platforms.
	  Attempts to introspectively select task affinity to optimize power
	  and performance. Basic support for multiple (>2) cpu types is in place,
	  but it has only been tested with two types of cpus.
	  There is currently no support for migration of task groups, hence
	  !SCHED_AUTOGROUP.

config MTK_SCHED_RQAVG_KS
	bool "Enable runqueue statistic calculation used in kernel space operation"
	depends on SMP
	help
	  MTK ruqueue statistic kernel space CPUfreq governors, e.g., hotplug
	  TLP estimation,
	  heavy task detection and
	  per CPU load for kernel space CPUfreq governors

config MTK_SCHED_RQAVG_US
	bool "Enable runqueue staticsic calculation used in user space operation"
	depends on SMP && HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	help
	  MTK runqueue staticsic calculation
	  used in user space operation.
	  TLP estimation for user space
	  CPUfreq governors.

config MTK_SCHED_CPULOAD
	bool "Enable timing-base CPU loading tracking in scheduler"
	depends on MTK_SCHED_RQAVG_US
	help
	  Support timing-base CPU loading tracking
	  in scheduler tick.
	  Which helps load tracking in time-base view
	  and more quick response in loading change.

config MTK_SCHED_SYSHINT
	bool "Enable asynchronus hint for external modules to get loading change in time"
	help
	  Support asynchronus hint for external modules
	  to get loading change notification from scheduler
	  in time that helps resource control
	  in low latency.
